# OffscreenBusRide
Moves objects to the bus when offscreen and disables them, reactivates them when back onscreen.

Place OffscreenBusRide.cs in the object you want to add to the bus. 
Add a new empty gameobject to the scene, call it ObjectBusSystem and add the ObjectBusSystem script.
Should now be working.
